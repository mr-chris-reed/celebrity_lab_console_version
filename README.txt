Due to some limitations in Replit, we are going to implement a modified version of the Celebrity lab that works in the console.

Our program will have at least the two Java classes: Celebrity, CelebrityGame

The Celebrity class models a celebrity.

The CelebrityGame models all aspects of the game.

The CelebrityGame will have the following methods.
These may be modified during development.
We may find that we need to add more methods as well.

+CelebrityGame()
+prepareGame()
+validateCelebrity()
+validateClue()
+addCelebrity()
+getUserInput()
+printMessage()
+processGuess()
+play()
